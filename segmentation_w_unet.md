## What is Segmentation?
---
## Classification

---
## Where is Segmentation Used?
---
## Street View

---
## Training UNet

[CamVid with UNet Notebook](./nbs/lesson3-camvid.pdf)

---

## Challenges with Unit

* Memory Usage High

---

## Alternatives to Unet

---
## FRRN Full-Resolution Residual Networks
